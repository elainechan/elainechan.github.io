This is a summary of what I learned about the intelligence cycle through a Google search.

### The Intelligence Cycle
The following are the six steps in an intelligence cycle. Each step is a seprate function in the sense that the objectives are different for each stage, although the steps do not necessarily have to occur discretely or chronologically in the order specified.

1. Requirements: develop intelligence requirements
2. Collection: build a pipeline to acquire the data
3. Processing: digest the data into consumable input for analysis
4. Analysis: translate the data into actionable information
5. Dissemination: deliver the finished intelligence to the right people
6. Feedback: receive user comments on the product and make changes accordingly

## Intelligence Requirements
Intelligence requirements (IRs) are a set of guidelines for conducting the operations of the rest of the intelligence cycle.

### Steps
1. Identify and prioritize critical assets
    - What are the assets that are critical to the survival of your business?
    - Which one of those assets, should it be compromised, would kill your business first?
2. Identify adversaries and their objectives
    - Who had previously targeted your assets?
    - Who had previously targeted similar businesses or similar assets?
    - Adversaries are usually financially motivated, seeking personally identifiable information (PII), login credentials, etc. for monetization schemes.
3. Narrow operational focus
    - Be specific and concrete.
    - What are the tactics, techniques, and procedures ([TTP](http://ryanstillions.blogspot.com/2014/04/on-ttps.html))?
    - For example: what types of social engineering tactics are most likely to result in a successful business email compromise (BEC) scam? What types of employee training could help prevent this?

## Priority Intelligence Requirements

Priority intelligence requirements (PIRs) are intelligence requirements which are critical to accomplishing the mission. Basically, they are a handful of IRs that are more important than all other IRs: the manager approves a prioritized list of IRs and designates some of them as PIRs.

## Collection Requirements
Collection requirements inform data collection operations in the intelligence cycle. The first part is to identify, prioritize, and document observables and inputs that are needed to fullfil IRs. The second part is to specify the technical implementations needed to fulfill collection requirements.
