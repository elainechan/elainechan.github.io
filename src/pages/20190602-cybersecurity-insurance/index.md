## Economic and Social Costs of Attacks
Cybersecurity breaches have captured the imagination of society, because attacks have done tangible damage to private citizens, at a scale large enough to attract the attention of mainstream media. If you are an American who uses credit scores, you can relate to the victims of the [Equifax data breach](https://www.ftc.gov/equifax-data-breach) in 2017, during which personally identifiable information of more than 146 million Equifax customers were stolen.

In its 2018 [annual report](https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/equifax/SEC/sec-show.aspx?Type=html&FilingId=13243973&CIK=0000033185&Index=10000), Equifax recorded technology and data security costs of $146.5 million in 2018 pertaining to the data breach. The company did have a cybersecurity insurance policy, and it had already received the maximum reimbursement of $125 million. In its [first-quarter report](https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/Thatus/equifax/SEC/sec-show.aspx?Type=html&FilingId=13421771&CIK=0000033185&Index=10000), Equifax said it had set aside $690 million of estimated spending related to the data breach, exclusive of legal and professional service fees. That comes to a total cost of $961.5 million.

Credit ratings agency Moody's [revised](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-affirms-Equifax-sr-uns-at-Baa1-revises-outlook-to--PR_400804) the outlook of Equifax to negative (i.e. it is now riskier to lend money to Equifax) due to the data breach, which is the [first time](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/22/moodys-downgrades-equifax-outlook-to-negative-cites-cybersecurity.html) a company's credit outlook has been changed due to cybersecurity risks. Moody's estimates the total cost of the Equifax data breach at more than $1.4 billion.

## Cyberspace
What is cyberspace? From the defense perspective:

> _Cyberspace as a warfighting domain is a very challenging concept. The temptation to classify it as just another domain, like air, land, sea, and space, is frequently the first mistake that’s made by our military and political leaders and policymakers._
-- _Inside Cyber Warfare_, Jeffrey Carr, O'Reilly 2011

Alternatively:
1. Cyberspace is a realm that encompasses the domains of air, land, sea, and space; OR
2. Cyberspace is a component of each of those domains.

Either way, this concerns anyone who uses any of these spaces, i.e. all human beings.

## Challenges of Insuring Cybersecurity Risks
A variant of Murphy's Law (_"anything that can go wrong will go wrong"_), Finagle's Law states that _"anything that can go wrong, will —-- at the worst possible moment."_ Insurance is often unhelpful in moments like this.

Catastrophic events such as terrorism, natural disasters, and acts of war are often not covered by most commercial insurance plans. For similar reasons, insurance policies by default do not cover cyber incidents. To address an unmet need, cybersecurity insurance was born:

> _A cyber insurance policy, also referred to as cyber risk insurance or cyber liability insurance coverage (CLIC), is designed to help an organization mitigate risk exposure by offsetting costs involved with recovery after a cyber-related security breach or similar event. With its roots in errors and omissions (E&O) insurance, cyber insurance began catching on in 2005, with the total value of premiums forecasted to reach $7.5 billion by 2020. According to PwC, about one-third of U.S. companies currently purchase some type of cyber insurance._
-- [CIO.com](https://www.cio.com/article/3065655/what-is-cyber-insurance-and-why-you-need-it.html)

> _Cybersecurity insurance is designed to mitigate losses from a variety of cyber incidents, including data breaches, business interruption, and network damage._
-- [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/cisa/cybersecurity-insurance)

While uncertainty is the business of insurance, most of the problems insurers deal with are "known unknowns," and cybersecurity risk is an "unknown unknown."

> _The primary problem for cyber insurers is that there is no established historical corpus of understanding for cybersecurity risk in the same way as there is for, say, motor or life insurance. Insurance works best with static risk, but cyber risk is intrinsically dynamic -- both the target (the IT infrastructure) and the attack methodology (attackers, tools, techniques, exploits and motivation) are continuously changing. Neither the insurer nor the insured currently understands how cybersecurity can be insured._
-- [SecurityWeek](https://www.securityweek.com/new-cyber-insurance-firm-unites-insurance-cyber-intelligence)

It is not only hard to quantify abstract losses (data loss), but concrete losses (physical damage and bodily harm) are also hard to quantify in the context of cybersecurity attacks.

> _Few cybersecurity insurance policies, however, provide businesses with coverage for an area of growing private and public concern: the physical damage and bodily harm that could result from a successful cyber attack against critical infrastructure._
-- [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/cisa/cybersecurity-insurance)

## Critical Infrastructure
State level attacks on critical infrastructure, once the plot devices of science fiction, are now conceivable by an average person who reads the news. It would not be surprising that the next world war could be a cyber war; the attacks would be performed by people sitting in front of computers, but the damage would occur in the physical world on a large scale. Enterprise level attacks are already happening in the abstract world of critical data, although attacks in the physical world of critical infrastructure is also conceivable, and perhaps more frightening.

> _There are 16 critical infrastructure sectors whose assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, are considered so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination thereof._
-- [Department of Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/cisa/critical-infrastructure-sectors)

These critical infrastructure sectors are:
- Chemical
- Commercial Facilities
- Communications
- Critical Manufacturing
- Dams
- Defense Industrial Base
- Emergency Services
- Energy
- Financial Services
- Food and Agriculture
- Government Facilities
- Healthcare and Public Health
- Information Technology
- Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste
- Transportation Systems
- Water and Wastewater

Some examples of possible attack vectors:
- Ground transportation infrastructure (e.g. mass transit, highways)
- Aviation infrastructure (e.g. airports)
- Energy infrastructure (e.g. electric power grid)
- Communications infrastructure (e.g. air traffic control systems, traffic signaling systems)
- Healthcare facilities (e.g. connected devices in hospitals)

Some example scenarios:
- All trains in an entire city reverse direction and change tracks, leading to numerous massive collisions.
- All airports in an entire nation shuts down at the same time.
- All traffic signaling of a city radomizes, creating large numbers of road collisions.

If an attack is perpetrated by a state actor, it would probably be deemed an act of war, which is usually excluded from insurance coverage. If the perpetrator is a party other than a state actor, it should be covered.

## Department of Homeland Security Initiative
DHS is working with enterprise stakeholders to develop a model for managing cyber risk, and is planning to reward businesses that adopt them. This is meant to encourage insurers to accurately address the changing cybersecurity needs of enterprises. Some of the key areas are:

1. Data collection
    - Sharing anonymized data of cyber incidents in a repository.
2. Analytics
    - Use the data to develop scenarios, simulations and models.
3. Integration 
    - Incorporate cyber risk into existing Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) frameworks.

The Department of Commerce enjoys popular success with the wide adoption of the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2018/04/nist-releases-version-11-its-popular-cybersecurity-framework); perhaps this yet unnamed DHS initiative would integrate nicely into that.
