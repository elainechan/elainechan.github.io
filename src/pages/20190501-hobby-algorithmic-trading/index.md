Wanna be a quant but don't have a PhD? Looking for a stimulating side hustle? Let's become a hobby algorithmic trader.

## General Observations
- Everyone run towards the same thing, at the same time.
- When something is perceived as unavailable or is expected to become unavailable, people want it more and/or are willing to pay more for it.
- Liquidity has always run away in a crisis (and probably will again).
- Big data and the application of machine learning is an arms race.
- The _real_ advantage (arms/weapons) is access to data and resources.
- Analysis _can_ become a marginal advantage, in the sense that a weapon (data) is only useful if you know how to use it well. Learn to process the big data first; if you’re marginally better at it, it can be a marginal advantage forever.
- When seeking room for innovation, determine who is making the monopoly rents, and start there.
- Since markets are inefficient and abundant, retail investors do have a chance of getting _something_. There is food left after the lions (institutional investors) have been fed; there are also places where the lions have not looked.

## Adages
Some funny quotes to brighten the day.

- In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice; in practice, there is. (Commonly attributed to Yogi Berra)
- Be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy. (Commonly attributed to Warren Buffett)
- The trend is your friend (until it ends).
- Bulls make money, bears make money but pigs get slaughtered.

## Rules
Kind of like "brush your teeth twice a day; once in the morning, and once before bed."

- No overnight holdings if you want any sleep at night.
- Don't do intraday trading manually; you are disadvantaged without the access to rumors on trading floors. You will get whipsawed and burn out.
- _No_ high-frequency trading: would not work for retail investors because of lack of resources (e.g. true real-time data).

## Metrics
Portfolio management, to dramatically oversimplify things, is throwing a bunch of formulas at some data and getting an output. Kind of like computer programming. Here are some of the Lego pieces.

	> Can factors break down, become commoditized, or simply stop working? Absolutely. The main tool that many people use these days to monitor the state of where we are and whether these are being arbitraged away is the VALUE SPREAD. Any factor can be thought of as a long/short portfolio. On various value metrics — any of your favorites, price-to-earnings, sales-to-book — how expensive are the longs vs. the shorts? For the value factor itself, the longs always look cheap by definition. But for the other factors, it varies, and all of them have a range through history. None of that is at levels where the factors have not done well going forward.

    > "Private investing. I think there’s an opening for someone to be the Vanguard or AQR of private investing, putting in enough work to make sure we’re getting a fair price and then charging a third of what everyone else charges. I don’t know that world enough, but I think it’s an interesting place. One great way—in any part of the economy—to see where there’s room for innovation: Who’s making monopoly rents?"
