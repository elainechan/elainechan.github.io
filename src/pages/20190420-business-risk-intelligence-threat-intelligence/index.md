Business risk intelligence(BRI), as a discipline, is a superset of threat intelligence. In addition to the cybersecurity issues addressed by threat intelligence, BRI also addresses physical threats, insider threats, and fraud.

Cybersecurity risks can no longer be confined to the IT department because it often involves legal implications (in the case of a customer data breach) and threatens business continuity as well as reputation. As opposed to approaching cybersecurity as an incident response problem, a new approach is to treat cybersecurity threats as a long-term risk to be managed continuously. Business risk intelligence was born from this development.

There is not a whole lot of learning resources available for BRI, perhaps because of its youth as a discipline; the available literature mostly consists of whitepapers and blog posts written by industry practitioners.

corporate espionage
employee retaliation

Risk = threat x likelihood x impact
