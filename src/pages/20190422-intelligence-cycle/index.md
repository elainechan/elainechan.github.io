### The Intelligence Cycle
1. Requirements: develop intelligence requirements
2. Collection: build a pipeline to acquire the data
3. Processing: digest the data into consumable input for analysis
4. Analysis: translate the data into actionable information
5. Dissemination: deliver the finished intelligence to the right people
6. Feedback: receive user comments on the product and make changes accordingly

## Intelligence Requirements
Intelligence requirements are a set of guidelines for conducting the operations of the rest of the intelligence cycle.

### Steps
1. Identify and prioritize critical assets
    - What are the assets that are critical to the survival of your business?
    - Which one of those assets, should it be compromised, would kill your business first?
2. Identify adversaries and their objectives
    - Who had previously targeted your assets?
    - Who had previously targeted similar businesses or similar assets?
    - Adversaries are usually financially motivated, seeking personally identifiable information (PII), login credentials, etc. for monetization schemes.
3. Narrow operational focus
    - Be specific and concrete. For example: what types of social engineering tactics are most likely to result in a successful business email compromise (BEC) scam? What types of employee training could help prevent this?
